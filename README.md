# Implementing-Artificial-Neural-Network-training-process-in-Python

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a data processing paradigm inspired by the brain. ANNs, like humans, learn by doing. Through a learning process, 
an ANN is trained for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data categorization. Learning mostly entails changes to the synaptic connections
that occur between neurons. 
 
 
A neural network is a type of artificial neural network.
The brain is made up of hundreds of billions of neurons. These neurons are linked together by synapses, 
which are simply the connections that allow one neuron to transmit an impulse to another. 
When one neuron provides an excitatory signal to another, that signal is added to all of that neuron's other inputs. 
If it surpasses a certain threshold, it will.
